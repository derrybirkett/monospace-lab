	<p>
		Monospace Lab is where I document what I build. Infrastructure, automation,
		self-hosted systems, and the decisions behind them.
	</p>

	<p>
		I’m Derry Birkett — based in Barcelona, building systems that are sovereign,
		resilient, and intentional. Currently working on HomeCloud (a self-healing
		private cloud on a Mac mini) and PIP (an agentic development platform).
	</p>

	<p>
		Everything here is real — real projects, real trade-offs, real infrastructure.
		No tutorials. No theory. Just what actually works.
